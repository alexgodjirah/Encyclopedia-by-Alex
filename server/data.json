Its head has a tiara-like crown of small horns. It summons ice to cover its wings, limbs, and tail. Its thin, lance-like tail is hightly flexible and can jab at enemies.",
        "behavior_and_abilities": "Velkhana freely controls ice and cold wind, and can cover wide areas in ice in an instant. It breathes beams of supercooled fluid that can instantly freeze monsters. When covered in its ice armor, ice crystals form nearby, and when struck by Velkhana's ice breath they form large spires that soon explode. Small ice platforms sometimes form, which can be jumped off of. Occasionally, spikes of ice rain from clouds close to the ground when it enraged.",

        "physiology": "Amatsu has a unique body structure. The head itself is quite small, though it is adorned with massive golden horns, flanked by tendrils of flesh. Amatsu's body is largely pale white in color, and covered entirely in fins that stretch along all four limbs. From its back rise more pointed fins, whereas its underside is grey and scaled. Because it flies through the air and spends no time on land, Amatsu has almost vestigial feet and small, nearly useless back legs. The front legs are bordered by more white fins. When enraged, red veins stand out more prominently in its wing membranes, and when near death, its chest, horns and eyes shine with a faint golden luminescence.",
        "behavior_and_abilities": "In battle, Amatsu hovers above the ground. Its movements are reminiscent of fighting the Leviathans underwater, and many of its attacks are similar to those used by them, such as the charge, tail whip, and roar. It also has a wind barrier around its body, but unlike Kushala Daora's wind barrier, it cannot blow the hunter over. However, Ballista shots will be somewhat less effective as long as the barrier remains active. The barrier is also less stable than Daora's, as it temporarily disappears when Amatsu uses certain attacks. One of its most dangerous attacks is when it creates a small twister that begins to suck in the hunter, then hits them hard with a tornado-shrouded charge. Even if the first main twister is avoided, it will revolve around the second twister, encompassing a wider area with every revolution. If the hunter is close enough when hit, it will cause the hunter to fly back into the twister. The second twister will remain on the field for several seconds before disappearing and can still damage the hunter. When weakened enough, Amatsu uses other powerful move: it flies high into the air and uses three massive water beams. The attack consists of two parts; the beams strike the ground, followed by explosion of water.",
        "description": "A legendary elder dragon spotted on Sacred Pinnacle. An avatar of storms in the folklore of Yukumo Village, Amatsu's appearance is accompanied by furious cyclones and horrific storms. Its fearsome power is said to outscale that of natural disasters."
